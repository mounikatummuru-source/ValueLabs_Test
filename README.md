# Backend Developer Code Challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to the Backend Developer Technical Assessment! This test is designed to evaluate your proficiency in building REST APIs using .NET 8, focusing on clean architecture, business logic, and testing practices. We have prepared a set of tasks and questions that cover a spectrum of skills, ranging from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics.

**Note:** This assessment focuses on API development, architecture, and testing. During the interview, we'll discuss your experience with databases, event-driven design, Docker/Kubernetes, and cloud platforms.

## Tasks
Complete the provided tasks to demonstrate your ability to work with .NET 8, ASP.NET Core Web API, and unit testing. Adjust the complexity based on your experience level.

## Questions
Answer the questions to showcase your understanding of the underlying concepts and best practices associated with the technologies in use.

## Time Limit
This assessment is designed to take approximately 1-2 hours to complete. Please manage your time effectively.

## Setup the Repository
Make sure you have .NET 8 SDK installed
- Install dependencies with `dotnet restore`
- Build the project with `dotnet build`
- Run the project with `dotnet run --project CodeChallenge.Api`
- Navigate to `https://localhost:5095/swagger` to see the API documentation

## Prerequisite
Start the test by forking this repository, and complete the following tasks:

---

## Task 1
**Assignment:** Implement a REST API with CRUD operations for messages. Use the provided `IMessageRepository` and models to create a `MessagesController` with these endpoints:
- `GET /api/v1/organizations/{organizationId}/messages` - Get all messages for an organization
- `GET /api/v1/organizations/{organizationId}/messages/{id}` - Get a specific message
- `POST /api/v1/organizations/{organizationId}/messages` - Create a new message
- `PUT /api/v1/organizations/{organizationId}/messages/{id}` - Update a message
- `DELETE /api/v1/organizations/{organizationId}/messages/{id}` - Delete a message

**Question 1:** Describe your implementation approach and the key decisions you made.

**Answer 1:** I had used the CLEAN architecture, Changed some files to different libraries as per CLEAN architecture. Kept DTO's, Mappers, Interfaces in Application layer. Kept Models in Domain layer, Implemented Repository in Infrastructure layer.
We have added the Dependency Injection in program.cs by using extension methods.

**Question 2:** What would you improve or change if you had more time?

**Answer 2:** I would have implemented the business Class between Controller and Repository layer. Implement the Global exception handling. Logging each and every request and response, Appending Correlation-id in the Request header if not appended adding dynamically.

## Task 2
**Assignment:** Separate business logic from the controller and add proper validation.
1. Implement `MessageLogic` class (implement `IMessageLogic`)
2. Implement Business Rules:
   - Title must be unique per organization
   - Content must be between 10 and 1000 characters
   - Title is required and must be between 3 and 200 characters
   - Can only update or delete messages that are active (`IsActive = true`)
   - UpdatedAt should be set automatically on updates
3. Return appropriate result types (see `Logic/Results.cs`)
4. Update Controller to use `IMessageLogic` instead of directly using the repository

**Question 3:** How did you approach the validation requirements and why?

**Question 4:** What changes would you make to this implementation for a production environment?

## Task 3
**Assignment:** Write comprehensive unit tests for your business logic.
1. Create `CodeChallenge.Tests` project (xUnit)
2. Add required packages: xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions
3. Write Tests for MessageLogic covering these scenarios:
   - Test successful creation of a message
   - Test duplicate title returns Conflict
   - Test invalid content length returns ValidationError
   - Test update of non-existent message returns NotFound
   - Test update of inactive message returns ValidationError
   - Test delete of non-existent message returns NotFound

**Question 5:** Explain your testing strategy and the tools you chose.

**Question 6:** What other scenarios would you test in a real-world application?
